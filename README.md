# Android-Quotes-App---Firestore-Cloud-Integration
# Overview

This app is meant to be an upgrade of my previous android app. This app is in progress still. There are locally stored quotes stored in arrays for the application to access. The purpose to integrate with Firestore Cloud is to free up space in the code and for me to learn effiency in data storage. I also hope to understand Firestore Cloud (and other Cloud databases) better.
